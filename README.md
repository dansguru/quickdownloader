# Nexify App Installer

A web application that detects device information and provides the appropriate APK download for users.

## How It Works

1. When a user visits the site, the application detects if they're on a desktop or mobile device
2. Desktop users see a message directing them to contact Nexify customer care
3. Mobile users see their device information and a download button
4. The application detects the device's architecture, screen density, and language
5. When the user clicks download, the appropriate APK is selected and downloaded
